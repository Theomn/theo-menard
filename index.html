    <main><h2>‚ú® Howdy!</h2>
        <p>My name is Theo, I am a game developer and artist based in Montreal, Canada. I am passionate about games, the wide spectrum of what they are able to express, and the people that make them. </p>
        <p>I am fascinated about the creative potential of games, both in terms of mechanics and storytelling. I am always on the lookout for innovative ideas that push the industry forward. </p>
        <p>I also believe in care, community, and non-violent communication. As such, I hold accessibility for disabled and beginner gamers as a core value, and I am interested in non-violent games.

        <h2>üìù I am currently open for work.</h2>
        <p>I am looking for a position as technical designer, designer, or gameplay programmer in the video game industry in Montreal. With a versatile background, I can easily adapt to the needs of a production team; years of experience as a programmer means I am comfortable with complex systems, while occupying leading roles and being a professional game master means I can keep them digestible. See my CV above for more information.</p>
